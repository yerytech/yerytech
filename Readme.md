# Hello! 👋 I'm Yery, but you can call me YeryTech

Welcome to my GitHub repository! 
I am a software developer with experience in React, React Native, Flutter, and Kotlin. I enjoy creating useful and well-designed applications, both mobile and web, with the goal of learning and contributing.

I have worked on projects like Apuntes Domino, an app that simplifies scorekeeping for domino games, and I am the founder of SofPintao, an initiative focused on developing software that helps protect the environment.

I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow professionally and contribute with innovative solutions. Let’s connect!
